# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## The deep learning algorithm of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images using the Keras Sequential API.

This project is an example that was built along with a tensorflow tutorial showing how to create a multi-class classification model for CIFAR image dataset. Every stage of this project is explained below:

* Create and prepare the CIFAR10 dataset
* Verification of the dataset
* Create the convolutional neural network basement
* Adding the Dense layers on top
* Compile and train the model
* Evaluate the model!
